## üèÜ Third Place at FIAP NEXT Festival

AUTI is a gamified MVP developed to assist in the cognitive development of autistic children, achieving third place at the prestigious FIAP NEXT Festival.

## üìã About the Project

Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects a child's ability to communicate, understand social relationships, and behave adaptively in different contexts. Autistic children may face significant challenges in cognitive and social development, such as difficulties in verbal and non-verbal communication, limited social interactions, and repetitive behaviors. Each child on the autism spectrum is unique, with their own strengths and challenges. Early and personalized support is crucial to help these children develop essential skills and reach their full potential.

AUTI is an innovative and empathetic solution, created to help autistic children develop daily skills through a gamified approach. The project consists of two main components:

- **Frontend Web**: Interactive and accessible interface developed with React, TypeScript, and Vite
- **Backend API**: Robust service built with NestJS, TypeScript, and Prisma

### Key Features

- **Customized Mini-Games**: Games specifically designed to engage and educate autistic children
- **Accessible Visual Identity**: Design that minimizes sensory overload
- **Adaptive Learning Paths**: Personalized experience that adapts to each child's pace
